### Fun facts

1. It has ten hard drive slots, but only one slot is used, installed a single 240 GiB SATA intel SSD.

2. It has 1.408 TiB memory (12x32 GiB DRAM + 8x128 GiB Optane), and we plan to reach 1.92 TiB memory (12x32 GiB DRAM + 12x128 GiB Optane) next month.

3. There're two 24 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6252 CPU installed, with hyper-thread enabled, htop is like:

4. It takes 10 mins to boot, and loud enough to wake up everyone in the lab.

5. The operating system is Arch Linux, in fact all the server in the lab are running Arch Linux :) Half of the lab members, though, use Windows 10 (e.g. me).
