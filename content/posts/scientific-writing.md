Scientific writing can be tough, but we can improve it with some tricks and principles.
Here is a list of writing tips from the course **[Writing in the Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/home/welcome)**.

I'll keep adding new tips as I go through the course.

#### Do not convert verbs to nouns.
<div class="dono"> These findings imply that the rates of ascorbate radical <b>production</b> and its <b>recycling</b> via dehydroascorbate reductase to replenish the ascorbate pool are equivalent at the lower irradiance, 
but not equivalent at higher irradiance with the rate of ascorbate radical <b>production</b> exceeding its <b>recycling</b> back to ascorbate.</div>

<div class="do">These findings imply that, at low irradiation, ascorbate radicals are <b>produced</b> and <b>recycled</b> at the same rate,
but at high irradiation, they are <b>produced</b> faster than they can be <b>recycled</b> back to ascorbate.
</div>

#### Don't bury the main verb
<div class="dono">One study of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting <b>found</b> that
only two-thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS-related problem in the prior 6 months had done so.
</div>

<div class="do"><b>One study found that</b>, of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis who were receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting, 
only two-thirds of needing to contact a neurologist ... had done so.
</div>

#### Cut unnecessary words 
<div class="dono">This paper <b>provides a review of</b> the basic tenets of cancer biology study design,
using as examples studies that illustrate the methodologic challenges or <b>that demonstrate successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in biological research</b>. 
</div>

<div class="do">This paper <b>reviews</b> cancer biology study design, using examples that illustrate specific challenges and <b>solutions</b>.
</div>

<div class="dono">As it is well known, increased athletic activity has been related to a profile of lower cardiovascular risk,
lower blood pressure levels, and improved muscular and cardio-respiratory performance.</div>

<div class="do">Increased athletic activity is assoicated with lower cardivascular risk, lower blood pressure, and improved fitness</div>
<div class="do">Increased athletic activity lowers cardivascular risk and blood pressure, and improves fitness</div>

<div class="dono">The demonstration experiment is the first of its kind and is a proof of principle for the concept of laser driven 
particle acceleration in a structure loaded vaccum</div>

<div class ="do">The experiment provides a proof of principle of laser driven particle acceleration in a structure loaded vaccum.</div>

<div class="dono">Brian injury incidence shows two peak peroid in almost all reports: rates are the highest in young people and the elderly</div>
<div clas="do">Brian injury incidence peaks in the young and elderly</div>

#### Eliminate negatives
<div class="dono">They <b>did not believe</b> the drug was harmful.</div>

<div class="do">They believe the drug was safe.</div>

- Not honest - dishonest
- Not harmful - safe
- Does not have - lacks
- Did not pay attention to - ignored

#### Eliminate there are/there is
<div class="dono"> <b>There are</b> many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys.</div>

<div class="do">We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.</div>


#### Use active voice
<div class="dono">The activation of Ca++ channel <b>is induced by</b> the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ stores.</div>

<div class="do">Depleting Ca++ from the endoplasmic reticulum activates Ca++ channels.</div>

<div class="dono">Major differences in the reaction times of the two study subjects <b>were found</b>.</div>

<div class="do">Two study subjects differed in reaction times.</div>


#### Colon, semicolon and dash
**Colon**
<div class="dono">Many types of cells and tissues develop a kind of directionality.
Certain events happen toward one end of the cell or tissue or the other.
It's a phenomenon called cell polarity.</div>

<div class="do"> Many cells and tissues develop a kind of directionality called cell polarity<b>: certain events happen toward one end of the cell or tissue.</b></div>

**Semicolon**

Semicolon connects two independent clauses. 
A clause always contains a subject and predicate; an independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.
<div class="do">
It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; 
because leader enacted smart, forward-looking policies; 
because people's perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too.
</div>

**Dash**

Use the dash to add emphasis or to insert an abrupt definition or description almost anywhere in the sentence.
<div class="do">
The drugs did more than prevent new fat accumulation.
They also triggered overweight mice to shed significant amounts of fat <b>-- up to half their body weight</b>.
</div>
