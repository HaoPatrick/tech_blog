Scientific writing can be tough, but we can improve it with some tricks and principles.
Here is a list of writing tips from the course **[Writing in the Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/home/welcome)**.

I'll keep adding new tips as I go through the course.

#### Do not convert verbs to nouns.
> These findings imply that the rates of ascorbate radical **production** and its **recycling** via dehydroascorbate reductase to replenish the ascorbate pool are equivalent at the lower irradiance, 
but not equivalent at higher irradiance with the rate of ascorbate radical **production** exceeding its **recycling** back to ascorbate.

> These findings imply that, at low irradiation, ascorbate radicals are **produced** and **recycled** at the same rate,
but at high irradiation, they are **produced** faster than they can be **recycled** back to ascorbate.

#### Don't bury the main verb
> One study of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting **found** that
only two-thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS-related problem in the prior 6 months had done so.

> **One study found that**, of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis who were receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting, 
only two-thirds of needing to contact a neurologist ... had done so.

#### Cut unnecessary words 
> This paper **provides a review of** the basic tenets of cancer biology study design,
using as examples studies that illustrate the methodologic challenges or **that demonstrate successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in biological research**. 

> This paper **reviews** cancer biology study design, using examples that illustrate specific challenges and **solutions**.

#### Eliminate negatives
> They **did not believe** the drug was harmful.

> They believe the drug was safe.

- Not honest - dishonest
- Not harmful - safe
- Does not have - lacks
- Did not pay attention to - ignored

#### Eliminate there are/there is
> **There are** many ways in which we can arrange the pulleys.

> We can arrange the pulleys in many ways.


#### Use active voice
> A. The activation of Ca++ channel **is induced by** the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ stores.

> A. Depleting Ca++ from the endoplasmic reticulum activates Ca++ channels.

> B. Major differences in the reaction times of the two study subjects **were found**.

> B. Two study subjects differed in reaction times.
