Scientific writing can be tough, but we can improve it with some tricks and principles.
Here is a list of writing tips from the course **[Writing in the Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/home/welcome)**.

I'll keep adding new tips as I go through the course.

#### Do not convert verbs to nouns.
<div class="dono"> These findings imply that the rates of ascorbate radical <b>production</b> and its <b>recycling</b> via dehydroascorbate reductase to replenish the ascorbate pool are equivalent at the lower irradiance, 
but not equivalent at higher irradiance with the rate of ascorbate radical <b>production</b> exceeding its <b>recycling</b> back to ascorbate.</div>

<div class="do">These findings imply that, at low irradiation, ascorbate radicals are <b>produced</b> and <b>recycled</b> at the same rate,
but at high irradiation, they are <b>produced</b> faster than they can be <b>recycled</b> back to ascorbate.
</div>

#### Don't bury the main verb
<div class="dono">One study of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting <b>found</b> that
only two-thirds of those needing to contact a neurologist for an MS-related problem in the prior 6 months had done so.
</div>

<div class="do"><b>One study found that</b>, of 930 adults with multiple sclerosis who were receiving care in one of two managed care settings or in a fee-for-service setting, 
only two-thirds of needing to contact a neurologist ... had done so.
</div>

#### Cut unnecessary words 
<div class="dono">This paper <b>provides a review of</b> the basic tenets of cancer biology study design,
using as examples studies that illustrate the methodologic challenges or <b>that demonstrate successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in biological research</b>. 
</div>

#### Eliminate negatives

#### Colon, semicolon and dash
**Colon**
<div class="dono">Many types of cells and tissues develop a kind of directionality.
Certain events happen toward one end of the cell or tissue or the other.
It's a phenomenon called cell polarity.</div>

<div class="do"> Many cells and tissues develop a kind of directionality called cell polarity<b>: certain events happen toward one end of the cell or tissue.</b></div>

**Semicolon**

Semicolon connects two independent clauses. 
A clause always contains a subject and predicate; an independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.
<div class="do">
It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects;

**Dash**

Use the dash to add emphasis or to insert an abrupt definition or description almost anywhere in the sentence.

#### Use strong verbs

<div class = "dono">Evidence-based medicine teaches clinicians the practical application of clinical epidemiology, as needed to address specific problems of specific patients. It guides clinicians on how to find the best evidence relevant to a specific problem, how to assess the quality of that evidence, and perhaps most difficult, how to decide if the evidence applies to a specific patient. 
Finally, the lessons of clinical epidemiology are not meant to be limited to academic physician-epidemiologists, 
who sometimes have more interest in analyzing data than caring for patients.  Clinical epidemiology holds the promise of providing clinicians with the tools necessary to improve the outcomes of their patients. </div>
