### July 22th

First thing, before this term started, I was trying to make a paper before I apply for grad schools, 
but now, I almost admit that it's impossible to make a database system paper within half a year.

Implementation can be a bottleneck, time management can be a thing, but most importantly, the motivation doesn't last for long.
The ecstasy of having new ideas doesn't last for the whole project life cycle,
and I'll finally need to face the part that are not interesting but must be done.
These are the slow parts, and surviving these parts is the most important thing I should learn.

Another interesting thing, memories from some previous courses keeps pop up to my mind these days,
and these courses have one thing in common: I got terrible grades from these courses, but I actually learned a lot from the lectures.

One example is PHIL 101w, it discuses basic philosophy concepts and arguments,
I found them extremely interesting and challenging.

Let's reserve for tomorrow.
