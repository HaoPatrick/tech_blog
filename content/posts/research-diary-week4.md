### August 4th

Just finished my numa allocator implementation.

To the best of my knowledge, this mimalloc-based numa allocator is the first and best numa-aware allocator.

I'll release some of my slides after I present the basic idea to Tianzheng and Kevel. 


### August 2nd

Chengdu Hunters just secured there first lose in the Season 4 Overwatch League!

Nothing special today, reading some paper/topics.

"Branch prediction is not a solved problem" by Intel.

"Meltdown and Spectre"

That's it. Going to implement mimalloc numa-aware support.

First thing, before this term started, I was trying to make a paper before I apply for grad schools, 
but now, I almost admit that it's impossible to make a database system paper within half a year.

Implementation can be a bottleneck, time management can be a thing, but most importantly, the motivation doesn't last for long.
The ecstasy of having new ideas doesn't last for the whole project life cycle,
and I'll finally need to face the part that are not interesting but must be done.
These are the slow parts, and surviving these parts is the most important thing I should learn.

Another interesting thing, memories from some previous courses keeps pop up to my mind these days,
and these courses have one thing in common: I got terrible grades from these courses, but I actually learned a lot from the lectures.

One example is PHIL 101w, it discuses basic philosophy concepts and arguments,
I found them extremely interesting and challenging.

Let's reserve for tomorrow.
